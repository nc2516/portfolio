            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <h6>While staying at home due to covid over the summer of 2021, I decided to take SuperHi‚Äôs 8 Week UX Design course. This course project included a design brief and design guideline to follow. The goal of this project is to create a responsive e-commerce platform, called Marketplace All, that allows users to discover items and checkout as seamlessly as possible, utilizing the UX Design process.</h5>
            <h5>Problem Statement:</h5>
            <h6>Large companies dominate the furniture and home goods scene with mass produced, low quality, plain, and unsustainable items. Small brands that make those unique and environmentally friendly home goods are difficult to discover and scattered across the internet.</h6>
            <div class="italics"><h6>The primary goal of Marketplace All is to bring different like-minded brands together in one place, so people can discover new things and save time when searching for furniture and objects for their homes.</h6>
            </div>
            <h3>Research + Analyze</h3>
            <h5>Survey Results</h5>
            <h6>There were 28 responses to the survey</h6>
            <h6>
                <ul>
                    <li>The average answer was 3.4 for ‚Äúon a scale of 1-5: When I buy things, I'd rather buy high-quality, well-designed things I love, even if there are cheaper options.‚Äù</li>
                    <li>The average answer was 4 for ‚Äúon a scale of 1-5: finding unique, well-designed items for my home is important for me.‚Äù</li>
                    <li>27 (96.4%) said aesthetics are very influencial in their decision to buy furniture.</li>
                    <li>24 (85.7%) said quality is very influencial in their decision to buy furniture.</li>
                    <li>23 (82.1 %) said price is very influencial in their decision to buy furniture.</li>
                    <li>11 (39.3%) said convenience is very influencial in their decision to buy furniture.</li>
                    <li>3 (10.7%) said brand is very influencial in their decision to buy furniture.</li>
                </ul>
            </h6>
            <h5>Therefore:</h5>
            <h6>The order of importance from most influencial to least is 
                <br />Aesthetics ‚Üí Quality ‚Üí Price ‚Üí Convenience ‚Üí Brand</h6>
            <h5>User Personas</h5>
            <h6>I created user personas based off of the results of the survey.</h6>

            <h5>User Journey Map</h5>
            <h6>Based off of the various goals, I created seperate user maps, showcasing how users may navigate through Marketplace all to accomplish their goals.</h6>

            <img src="images/mp-journey.png"/>

            <h3>Design</h3>
            <h5>Low Fidelity Sketches</h5>
            <h6>I began by sketching out some rough low fidelity designs, keeping in consideration the important and imediate needs of the user.</h6>
            <img src="images/mp-sketch.png"/>

            <h5>Design Guideline</h5>
            <h6>A design guideline was provided by SuperHi, as well as product photography.</h6>
            <img src="images/mp-guide.png"/>

            <h5>Final Prototype</h5>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <h6>In the future, I would like to expand on this project and prototype the desktop version more in depth. As of right now, I only prototyped the phone version. I have not done any formal user testing but you may interact with the prototype <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/buYxGuA5JDJ99IQkU1MNg4/SuperHi%3A-Marketplace-All?node-id=2555%3A80&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=2555%3A80" target="_blank">here</a>, and feel free to give any feedback you may have.</h6>
